                    <h3>The First Bicylce</h3>
                    <p>
                        In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a wallking machine that
                        would help him get around the royal gardens faster: two same-
                        size in-line wheels, the front one steerable, mounted in a frame
                        upon which you straddled. The deviece was propelled by
                        pushing your feet against the ground, thus rolling yourself and
                        the device forward in a sort of gliding walk.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The machine bacame known as the Draisienne (or "hobby
                        horse"). It was made entirely of wodd. This enjoyed a short
                        lived popularity as a fad, not being pracitical for transoirtion in
                        any other place than a well maintained pathway such as in a 
                        park or garden.
                    </p>


                    <h1>Further Innovation</h1>
                    <p>
                        The next appearance of a two-wheeled riding machine was in 
                        1865., when pedels were applied driectly to the front wheel.
                        This machine was known as the velocipede (meaning "fast
                        foot") as well as the "bone shaker", since it's wooden structure 
                        combined with the cobbleestone roads of the day made for an
                        extremely uncomfortavle ride. They also became a fad and
                        indoor riding academies, similar to rller rinks, could be found 
                        in large cities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 1870 the first all-metal
                        machine appeared. The pedals
                        were atttached directly to the
                        front wheel. Solid rubber tires and the long sopkes of the large front wheel
                        provided a much smoother ride
                        than its perdecessor.
