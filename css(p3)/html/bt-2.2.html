                    In 1817 Baron von Drais
                    invented a walking machine that
                    would help him get around the royal gardens faster.

                    The device know as the 
                    Draisiemme(or "habby horse")
                    was made of wood, and
                    propelled by pushing your feed
                    an the ground in a gliding

                    any place orther than a well

                In 1865, the velocipede
                (meaning "fast foot") attached
                peals to the front wheel, but its
                wooden structure made it
                extremely uncomfortable.

                In 1870 the first all-metal
                machine appeared. The pedals
                were atttached directly to the
                front wheel.

                    Solid rubber tires and the long sopkes of the large front wheel
                    provided a much smoother ride
                    than its perdecessor.
