                    In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking machine that
                    would help him get around the royal gardens faster: two same-
                    size in-line wheels, the front one steerable, mounted in a
                    frame upon which you straddled. The device was propelled by 
                    pushing your feet against the ground, thus rolling yourself and 
                    the device forward in a sort of gliding walk.
                </p>
                <p> The machine became known as the Draisienne (or "hobby 
                    horse"). It was made entirely of wood. This enjoyed a short lived popularity as a fad, not being practical for 
                    transportation in any other place.
