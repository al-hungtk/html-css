     <p class="font-3">The <span class="font-z">briard</span>, or berger de brie, is a large breed of dog traditionally used as a herder and guardian of sheep</p>
     <p class="font-4">Breed History</p>
     <p class="font-5"> The briard, which us believed to have originated in France, has been bred for centuries to herd and to protect sheep. The breed was<br>
        used by the French Army as sentries, messengers and to search for wounded  soldiers because of its fine sense of hearing. Briards <br>
        were used in the First World War almost to the point of extinction. Currently the population of briards is slowly recovering. <br>
        Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson and Lafayette all owned briards.
